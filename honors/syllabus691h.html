<h1 id="econ691h-fall2017-syllabus">Econ691H - Fall 2017 - Syllabus</h1>

<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>

<p>Students conduct original research under the supervision of faculty members. The end product is an honors thesis.</p>

<h2 id="organization">Organization</h2>

<p>Class meets Tue, Thr 9:30&#8211;10:45 in Gardner 309.</p>

<p>Broad outline:</p>

<ol>
<li>Guidance on how to do research.</li>
<li>Students identify broad research areas and pair up with advisors.</li>
<li>Advisors help with formulation of precise topics.</li>
<li>Student presentations of their research projects. Seminar format.</li>
</ol>

<p>A more detailed <a href="schedule691h.html">schedule</a> is available.</p>

<p>I set up a <code>slack</code> to facilitate communication. There, everyone can ask questions, answer questions, or comment on everyone&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>I recommend bringing a laptop to class.</p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<p>Grades are based on:</p>

<ol>
<li>Class participation (20%)</li>
<li>Preliminary proposal draft (25%)

<ol>
<li>due <strong>Oct&#8211;24</strong></li>
<li>20 minute presentation with class discussion</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Final proposal draft (40%)

<ol>
<li>due <strong>Nov&#8211;14</strong></li>
<li>30 minute presentation with class discussion</li>
</ol></li>
<li><a href="#discussiondetails">Detailed discussion</a> of another student&#8217;s final proposal, due <strong>Nov&#8211;28</strong> (15%)</li>
</ol>

<p>Late submissions receive half credit. Submissions handed in after finals week receive no credit.</p>

<h2 id="preliminaryproposaldraft">Preliminary Proposal Draft</h2>

<p>By the middle of the fall term, you should have identified a topic and done background research on it.</p>

<p>Length: about 5 pages.</p>

<p>Your proposal should cover:</p>

<ol>
<li>Motivation: what is the question and why is it important?</li>
<li>Approach: Roughly how do you plan to answer the question?</li>
<li>Contribution: how does it fit into the literature? What is new?</li>
<li>For empirical projects:

<ol>
<li>Data sources: description and summary statistics for the variables that you plan to use.</li>
<li>Outline the econometric procedures that you plan to use.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>For theoretical projects:

<ol>
<li>Sketch the model.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Detailed bibliography</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="finalproposaldraft">Final Proposal Draft</h2>

<p>By the end of the semester, you should have produced a detailed outline of your research plans and methods.</p>

<p>The final proposal is structured like the preliminary one, but more detailed and polished. Detailed feedback will be provided by our advisor and by another student.</p>

<p><strong>By the last day of classes</strong>, you should submit a revised draft that addresses these comments.</p>

<p>Length: 15&#8211;20 pages.</p>

<h2 id="discussiondetails">Discussion of another student&#8217;s thesis</h2>

<p>Each student submits a critical discussion of another student&#8217;s final proposal. This will be similar to a referee report for a journal article.</p>

<p>The discussion should cover:</p>

<ol>
<li>Very brief summary of what the thesis does.</li>
<li>Is the <strong>question</strong> clear and well motivated? How could it be sharpened?</li>
<li>Is the <strong>contribution</strong> relative to the literature clear and significant? How could it be sharpened?</li>
<li>Are the <strong>methods</strong> appropriate? How could they be improved?</li>
<li>Are the <strong>results</strong> compelling? What could go wrong? How could one address potential objections?</li>
</ol>

<p>A good discussion is constructive. It points out weaknesses, but also proposes improvements.</p>

<p>There is no prescribed length. However, I expect that the discussant has thought carefully about the thesis.</p>

<h2 id="expectationsforathesis">Expectations for a Thesis</h2>

<p>A thesis presents original research. It will typically cover:</p>

<ol>
<li>Introduction

<ol>
<li>What is the question? Why is it interesting?</li>
<li>How is the question approached? Why is this reasonable?</li>
<li>What are the main findings?</li>
<li>What is the contribution to the literature?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Literature review

<ol>
<li>More details <a href="lit_review.html">here</a></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Outline of empirical methods

<ol>
<li>What are the challenges to be solved? (E.g., identify cause effect)</li>
<li>What econometric methods are used and why?</li>
<li>What could go wrong? Limitations.</li>
<li>Description of empirical model.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Data description

<ol>
<li>Summary of dataset: coverage, sample design, key variables.</li>
<li>Construction of key variables used in empirical model.</li>
<li>Limitations of the data.</li>
<li>Tables with summary statistics.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Results

<ol>
<li>Discussion of what you find when you estimate your model.</li>
<li>How to interpret the econometric results?</li>
<li>Robustness.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Conclusion

<ol>
<li>A redundant section that rehashes what was written above.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>There is no prescribed length. This is entirely dictated by what you need to say.</p>

<p>You should provide your computer code with the thesis.</p>

<p>You can find summaries of previous theses <a href="material/past_theses_summary.pdf">here</a>. Examples of successfully completed theses are <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0p766rbip520s3u/AAAy75U8q9ppJ9RNUOPF8kDMa?dl=0">here</a>.</p>
