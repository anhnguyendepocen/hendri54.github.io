<h1 id="econ691h-fall2018-syllabus">Econ691H - Fall 2018 - Syllabus</h1>

<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>

<p>Students conduct original research under the supervision of faculty members. The end product is an honors thesis.</p>

<p>Students are required to enroll in 691H in the fall and in 692H in the spring. Registration for 692H is automatic for all students enrolled in 691H.</p>

<h2 id="organization">Organization</h2>

<p>Class meets Mon, Wed 3:35 - 4:50, GA 307 (but we won&#8217;t meet often)</p>

<p>Broad outline:</p>

<ol>
<li>Guidance on how to do research.</li>
<li>Students identify broad research areas and pair up with advisors.</li>
<li>Advisors help with formulation of precise topics.</li>
<li>Students submit drafts at various points in the semester.</li>
</ol>

<p>A more detailed <a href="econ691h.html">schedule</a> is available.</p>

<p>I recommend bringing a laptop to class.</p>

<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

<p>I will ask for regular updates on your progress by email.</p>

<p>Especially at the start of the fall semester, as you look for a topic and advisor, we will have regular face-to-face meetings.</p>

<p>It is important to keep track of what has been communicated. After all, the thesis writing process takes several months. I will create a set of <code>slack</code> channels for each student. By default, only the student, his/her advisor, and I will have access to each channel. <code>Slack</code> is basically an alternative to email. It works rather like text messaging, but is more organized.</p>

<p>I have sent out <code>slack</code> invites to each of you. Please accept them.</p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<p>Grades are based on:</p>

<ol>
<li>Progress report on topic search and formulation (10%)

<ol>
<li>due Oct&#8211;1</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Preliminary proposal draft (30%)

<ol>
<li>due <strong>Oct&#8211;29</strong></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Final proposal draft (45%)

<ol>
<li>due <strong>Nov&#8211;26</strong></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Communication with me during the semester (one-on-one meetings and electronic discussions) (15%)</li>
</ol>

<p>Late submissions receive half credit. Submissions handed in after finals week receive no credit.</p>

<p>Please submit <strong>PDF files only.</strong></p>

<h2 id="progressreport">Progress report</h2>

<p>After the first month, you should have identified a draft topic and done background research on it.</p>

<p>Your report should cover:</p>

<ol>
<li>Rough description of the question or area of your thesis.</li>
<li>Sketch of a literature review that identifies where you plan to contribute.</li>
</ol>

<p>The main purpose is to ensure that you are making progress towards finding a topic and understanding how it fits into the literature.</p>

<h2 id="preliminaryproposaldraft">Preliminary Proposal Draft</h2>

<p>By the middle of the fall term, you should have identified a specific topic and done background research on it.</p>

<p>Length: about 5 pages. </p>

<p>Your proposal should cover:</p>

<ol>
<li>Motivation: what is the question and why is it important?</li>
<li>Approach: Roughly how do you plan to answer the question?</li>
<li>Contribution: how does it fit into the literature? What is new?</li>
<li>For empirical projects:

<ol>
<li>Data sources: description and summary statistics for the variables that you plan to use.</li>
<li>Outline the econometric procedures that you plan to use.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>For theoretical projects:

<ol>
<li>Sketch the model.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Detailed bibliography</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="finalproposaldraft">Final Proposal Draft</h2>

<p>By the end of the semester, you should have produced a detailed outline of your research plans and methods.</p>

<p>The final proposal is structured like the preliminary one, but more detailed and polished. Detailed feedback will be provided by your advisor and by me.</p>

<p><strong>By the last day of classes</strong>, you should submit a revised draft that addresses these comments.</p>

<p>Length: 15&#8211;20 pages. <strong>PDF files only</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="expectationsforathesis">Expectations for a Thesis</h2>

<p>A thesis presents original research. It will typically cover:</p>

<ol>
<li>Introduction

<ol>
<li>What is the question? Why is it interesting?</li>
<li>How is the question approached? Why is this reasonable?</li>
<li>What are the main findings?</li>
<li>What is the contribution to the literature?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Literature review

<ol>
<li>More details <a href="lit_review.html">here</a></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Outline of empirical methods

<ol>
<li>What are the challenges to be solved? (E.g., identify cause effect)</li>
<li>What econometric methods are used and why?</li>
<li>What could go wrong? Limitations.</li>
<li>Description of empirical model.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Data description

<ol>
<li>Summary of dataset: coverage, sample design, key variables.</li>
<li>Construction of key variables used in empirical model.</li>
<li>Limitations of the data.</li>
<li>Tables with summary statistics.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Results

<ol>
<li>Discussion of what you find when you estimate your model.</li>
<li>How to interpret the econometric results?</li>
<li>Robustness.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Conclusion

<ol>
<li>A redundant section that rehashes what was written above.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>There is no prescribed length. This is entirely dictated by what you need to say. <strong>PDF files only.</strong></p>

<p>You should provide your computer code with the thesis.</p>

<p>You can find summaries of previous theses <a href="material/past_theses_summary.pdf">here</a>. Examples of successfully completed theses are <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0p766rbip520s3u/AAAy75U8q9ppJ9RNUOPF8kDMa?dl=0">here</a>.</p>
