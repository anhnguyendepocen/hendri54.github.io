<h1 id="findingandadvisor">Finding and Advisor</h1>

<p>You should aim to meet with <strong>3&#8211;4 potential advisors</strong> during the first 3 weeks of classes.</p>

<p>First, pick a <strong>broad topic</strong>, such as income inequality, monetary policy, health, &#8230;</p>

<p>Then look for faculty members with expertise in this area. UNC Econ faculty is listed <a href="http://econ.unc.edu/people/faculty/">here</a> with their fields of interest. The following is a rough classification:</p>

<ul>
<li>Microeconomic theory (Biglaiser, Norman, Parreiras, Li, Yates, Woodward)</li>
<li>Macroeconomics (Aguilar, Francis, Alder, Parke, Rabinovic, Tian)</li>
<li>International economics (Conway, Chari, Alder, Rosefielde)</li>
<li>Econometrics (Babii, Verdier)</li>
<li>Financial/Time-series econometrics (Ghysels, Hill, Aguilar, Hansen)</li>
<li>Microeconometrics (Guilkey, Kim, Verdier)</li>
<li>Labor/education economics (Flabbi, Fruehwirth, Hincapie, Peter, Turchi)</li>
<li>Health economics (Gilleskie, Gong, Guilkey, Hincapie, Maini)</li>
<li>Industrial organization (Maini, McManus, Williams)</li>
<li>Environmental economics (Yates)</li>
<li>Development economics (Peter-micro; Conway and Alder-macro)</li>
</ul>

<p>The advisor must be permanent of adjunct faculty in the Department of Economics.</p>

<p>The following faculty are <em>not</em> available to advise in the Fall of 2018: Chari, Francis, Peter, Verdier.</p>

<p>Look at potential faculty members&#8217; web sites for their working papers and publications. You are looking for someone with an active research agenda.</p>

<p>Schedule appointments with a few potential advisors. </p>

<p><strong>Prepare</strong>. Think about potential topics and questions of interest. The more specific you can be, the better.</p>

<p>In your meetings, be concise and precise. Listen. </p>

<p>Do not get discouraged when an advisor &#8220;shoots down&#8221; your topic. This is normal. Most project ideas are bad. This remains true, even for people who have many years of research experience. See the notes on <a href="finding_topic.html">finding a topic</a>.</p>
