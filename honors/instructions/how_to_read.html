<h1 id="howtoreadpaperseffectively">How to Read Papers Effectively</h1>

<p>While you read, keep these questions in mind (due to Lee Ohanian):</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the question?</li>
<li>What is the approach?</li>
<li>Why is the approach reasonable?</li>
<li>What are the results?</li>
<li>How does the paper change the way I think about economics?</li>
</ol>

<p>Skip the details</p>

<ul>
<li>Unless you have to, focus on the big picture and skip implementation details.</li>
<li>Example: Acemoglu, Johnson &amp; Robinson

<ul>
<li>you may want to remember that the paper uses settler mortality as an instrument for institutions.</li>
<li>you don&#8217;t need to read in detail how the data are constructed, what controls are used in the regressions, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you need to pass judgement on the paper (do I find the results compelling?), then you need to sweat the details</li>
</ul>

<p>Take notes.</p>

<ul>
<li>While you read, make a structured bibliography in your favorite (outline capable) writing tool.</li>
</ul>
