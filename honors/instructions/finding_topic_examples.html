<p>&#8220;Human Capital and Development Accounting: New Evidence From Immigrant Earnings&#8221;, with Todd Schoellman</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: How important is human capital for cross-country income differences?</p>

<p><strong>Literature</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Measure human capital using years of schooling.</p>

<p>Problems: </p>

<ol>
<li>a year of schooling in Ghana is not the same as a year of schooling in the U.S.</li>
<li>human capital is more than schooling</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Model how human capital is produced.</p>

<p>Problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>inputs and outputs of human capital production not observed</li>
<li>results differ widely across studies</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Immigrant earnings.</p>

<p>Problems: immigrants are selected.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Idea</strong>: </p>

<ol>
<li>Build on the immigrant earnings idea: observe workers from the same country at home and in the U.S.</li>
<li>Address the selection problem by observing the same <em>person</em> in both countries (wage gains at migration).</li>
</ol>

<p>Data: New Immigrant Survey</p>

<h2 id="returnstoexperience">Returns to Experience</h2>

<p>&#8220;Accounting for Changing Returns to Experience&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Age-wage profiles have changed over time (changing returns to experience). Why?</p>

<p><strong>Literature</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Large descriptive literature does not directly address causality.</li>
<li>Various theoretical mechanisms:

<ol>
<li>Changing occupational mobility</li>
<li>Human capital accumulation on the job + rising college entry</li>
<li>Changing return to skill versus raw labor</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Idea</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Think of wage = efficiency * skill price</li>
<li>The literature tries to construct models where age efficiency profiles change over time and skill prices are more or less constant over time.</li>
<li>But we have reasons to believe that skill prices change substantially over time (separate literature).</li>
<li>What if we try this the other way around: hold age efficiency profiles constant and let skill prices vary over time?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Approach</strong>:</p>

<p>A very parsimonious model (that&#8217;s the whole point) where</p>

<ol>
<li>skill prices are a function of relative labor supplies (Katz &amp; Murphy)</li>
<li>age efficiency profiles are simply exogenous and constant over time</li>
<li>cohort effects (intercepts of age profiles) depend on cohort schooling</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="returntocollege">Return to College</h2>

<p>&#8220;The Return to College: Selection and Dropout Risk,&#8221; with Oksana Leukhina</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: </p>

<ul>
<li>College graduates earn about 60% more than high school graduates.</li>
<li>How much of that premium is selection? How much is return to college?</li>
</ul>

<p>Main challenge: <strong>selection</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>College graduates are &#8220;smarter&#8221; / higher ability than high school graduates.</li>
<li>Need to remove that selection effect from return to college.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Literature</strong>: Too massive to summarize</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Mincer returns: regress log wages on schooling and controls
Problems: selection confounds results.</p></li>
<li><p>IV</p>

<p>Problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>Hard to find instruments.</li>
<li>Each instrument hits a different treatment group.</li>
<li>IV returns to college are <em>lower</em> than OLS returns &#8211; hard to interpret.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Structural models of school choice</p>

<p>Problems: </p>

<ol>
<li>Identification is hard without a good measure of ability.</li>
<li>What happens in college is typically a black box.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Idea</strong>: College transcripts </p>

<ol>
<li>Transcripts offer information about student abilities.</li>
<li>Can observe how students progress through college. Can model incentives to persist or drop out.</li>
</ol>

<p>Approach: Structural model that models in detail how students progress through college.</p>

<h2 id="take-awaymessages">Take-Away Messages</h2>

<ol>
<li>Each project has a clearly defined, specific question.</li>
<li>In most cases, the question is not new.</li>
<li>The motivation for each project: a shortcoming in the existing literature. But you need to be constructive and have an idea how to do better.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="projectopportunities">Project Opportunities</h3>

<ol>
<li>New data (New Immigrant Survey, college transcripts).</li>
<li>New observations from known data

<ol>
<li>Example: Returns to experience are higher in richer countries (Lagakos et al., 2017, JPE).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Better identification (college transcripts help to measure student abilities).</li>
<li>A new mechanism to explain a known observation

<ol>
<li>But need supporting evidence for the mechanism.</li>
<li>Example: Test scores of college students rise over time relative to high school graduates. Suggests that selection accounts for rising college premium (Hendricks &amp; Schoellman, 2014 JME).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>A new question (rare)</li>
</ol>
