<h1 id="constructingatheoreticalmodel">Constructing a theoretical model</h1>

<p>A model is a simplified version of reality. Everything that is not needed to make the desired argument is deleted from reality.</p>

<p>A model has standard ingredients that need to be described:</p>

<ol>
<li>Demographics: what agents are in the model (households, firms, &#8230;). How do they enter the model (births)? How do they exit (deaths)?</li>
<li>Preferences: economic agents maximize something. What do they maximize?</li>
<li>Endowments: what do the agents have when the world starts? What do they have in each period (e.g. one unit of time to spend working).</li>
<li>Constraints:

<ol>
<li>households and firms face budget constraints</li>
<li>they may be additional constraints, such as borrowing limits</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Markets: what can be traded? How are markets organized?</li>
<li>Information structure: who knows what and when?</li>
</ol>

<p>With all this information, you can write down each agent&#8217;s constrained optimization problem. </p>

<h2 id="whatisagoodmodel">What Is a Good Model?</h2>

<ol>
<li>A good model is as simple as can be. Anything in the model needs to be motivated. Why is it needed to make the argument?</li>
<li>A good model is no simpler than needed. If there is a serious concern that omitting something will affect the conclusions, this needs to be defended.</li>
<li>Assumptions should be clear and their motivation must be explained.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="otherpoints">Other points</h2>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you describe clearly which parts of the model are borrowed from the literature.</li>
</ol>
