<p>It is a good idea to get a head start on the thesis process. If you have time during the summer, use it!</p>

<p>General notes:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="../links.html#pastTheses">Read a couple of theses</a> to get an idea of what is expected.</li>
<li>Read journal articles in areas you find interesting in order to expand your thesis topic ideas.</li>
<li>Talk to potential advisors to narrow down your topic. I can point you in the right direction.

<ol>
<li>See <a href="finding_advisor.html">finding an advisor</a> for more info and a list of economics faculty members by field.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Pick a software package and learn it.

<ol>
<li>See the <a href="../honors_faq.html">FAQ</a> for info on software.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>A lot of theses ask cause-effect questions. Review methods for estimating causal effects: instrumental variables, natural experiments.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have a reasonably specific topic in mind, talk to me. I can point you to potential advisors and help you to refine the topic.</p>
