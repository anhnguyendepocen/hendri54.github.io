<h1 id="writingaliteraturereview">Writing a Literature Review</h1>

<p>Sources:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="scholar.google.com">google scholar</a></li>
<li><a href="jstor.org">jstor</a></li>
<li>ask your librarian</li>
</ul>

<p>Good places to get started:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/jep/">Journal of Economic Perspectives</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/jel/">Journal of Economic Literature</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.elsevier.com/books/book-series/handbooks-in-economics">Handbook series</a>. Expert written literature reviews.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tricks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start with a recent article. Read its literature review. Follow its citations.</li>
<li>Start with an article that is highly relevant. See who cites it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="synthesizing">Synthesizing</h2>

<p>A good literature review is <strong>not</strong> a list of paper summaries. It uncovers a structured argument that is made in the literature.</p>

<p>Your goal is to determine areas of agreement and disagreement and their causes.</p>

<p>Ideally, you end up with a <strong>coherent narrative</strong> on how the literature has evolved. If you are lucky, the literature starts simple and then cumulatively builds on previous work. Unfortunately, this rarely works in economics.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: measuring the human capital stock of a country</p>

<ol>
<li>Early literature: years of schooling. Unanswered question: how much does a year of schooling contribute to output?</li>
<li>Mincer literature: Use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mincer_earnings_function">Mincer equation</a> to convert years of schooling into efficiency units of labor.</li>
<li>Implicit assumption: a year of schooling contributes the same to output in all countries. We should account for &#8220;school quality&#8221; differences.</li>
<li>Production function approach: To measure &#8220;school quality,&#8221; assume a human capital production function and measure inputs (such as school spending).</li>
<li>Drawback: findings depend on lot on the production function and identification strategy. Identification is very indirect.</li>
<li>Immigrant earnings approach: Measure human capital of a country by observing its workers in the U.S. labor market.</li>
<li>Drawback: assumptions on migrant selection must be made. Etc &#8230;</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="evaluatingsources">Evaluating Sources</h2>

<p>Searching <a href="scholar.google.com">google scholar</a> for references yields thousands of hits. You need to select promising ones. A source is promising if:</p>

<ul>
<li>it is published in a good journal</li>
<li>it is written by a prominent author (e.g., at a top university)</li>
<li>it is cited many times</li>
</ul>

<p>Use journal rankings (such as <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.journals.simple.html">repec&#8217;s</a>) to get a sense of the quality of a journal. Rankings often disagree a lot, but they agree on who is near the top.</p>
