<h1 id="undergraduatehonorsprogram:introduction">Undergraduate Honors Program: Introduction</h1>

<h3 id="collegeofartsandsciences–departmentofeconomics">College Of Arts And Sciences – Department Of Economics</h3>

<p>The Department of Economics honors program offers outstanding economics students the opportunity to work closely with an individual faculty member on a specialized research topic of the student’s choice during the senior year. Completing a successful honors thesis is the only way to graduate with honors or highest honors in economics at UNC.</p>

<p>Students writing an honors thesis are required to take <strong>ECON 691H</strong> in Fall 2019 and <strong>ECON 692H</strong> in Spring 2020. </p>

<p>Students must be in Chapel Hill during both semesters.</p>

<p>During the fall semester, students will find a thesis advisor, develop an economics-related research topic, collect data, and prepare a thesis proposal consisting of the review of literature and theoretical and/or empirical models. </p>

<p>In their spring semester, students whose research proposals are accepted will take ECON 692H. During this course, students will complete their thesis, receiving honors or highest honors status after an oral defense in front of a faculty board. Anyone can browse a list of past Honors theses at the <a href="links.html#pastTheses">Honors Thesis Archive</a>. </p>
