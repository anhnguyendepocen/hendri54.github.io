<h1 id="econ692h-spring2019-syllabus">Econ692H - Spring 2019 - Syllabus</h1>

<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>

<p>This is the second semester in the Economics Honors sequence. Students conduct original research under the supervision of faculty members. The end product is an honors thesis.</p>

<p>Students are required to enroll in 691H in the fall and in 692H in the spring. Registration for 692H is automatic for all students enrolled in 691H.</p>

<h2 id="organization">Organization</h2>

<p>I do not expect any class meetings or presentations (other than the thesis defense &#8211; see below). Instead, students will regularly report their progress and receive feedback from their advisor and from myself.</p>

<p>Deadlines:</p>

<ul>
<li>March 6: Submit your thesis to your advisor and to me for comments.</li>
<li>March 20: Respond to comments and resubmit your thesis to your advisor and to me.</li>
<li>March 25 to April 5: Oral thesis defenses.</li>
<li>April 8, by noon: <strong>Submit your thesis to me</strong>. This deadline is set by the Honors office. Do not miss it!</li>
<li>April 12: <a href="https://our.unc.edu/symposia/cur/">Celebration of undergraduate research</a>, 1:15 to 4:30 p.m.

<ul>
<li>An opportunity to present your research to a wider audience. Please attend!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>April 26 (last day of classes), by noon: Submit final version of your thesis electronically to the <a href="https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/forms/honors-thesis">Carolina Digital Repository</a>. Do not miss this deadline or you will not graduate with honors!

<ul>
<li>Email confirmation of submission to me.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Expectations for a Thesis:</p>

<ul>
<li>See the <a href="syllabus691h.html">syllabus for Econ691H</a>.</li>
<li>You should provide your computer code with the thesis.</li>
<li>More details are <a href="http://honorscarolina.unc.edu/research/senior-honors-thesis/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="oralthesisdefense">Oral thesis defense</h2>

<p>You will give a presentation before a committee that includes your advisor and myself (at least). While your advisor makes the final decisions about this, I suggest to aim for about 10 slides.</p>

<p>During the presentation, the committee will ask questions and make suggestions for improvements. Since everyone will know your paper fairly well, I don&#8217;t expect extensive comments.</p>

<p>Defenses are open for anyone to attend. I encourage all students to sit in on some defenses.</p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<p>Your grade will be entirely based on your thesis and the oral defense.</p>

<p>If you complete the thesis, you will graduate with honors or with highest honors.</p>

<p>If you do not complete your thesis, you must submit a term paper. You will then receive a course grade based on the paper and graduate without honors.</p>
