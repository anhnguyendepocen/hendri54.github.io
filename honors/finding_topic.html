<h1 id="findingatopic">Finding a Topic</h1>

<p>It is hard to overstate how <strong>important</strong> it is to find a good topic. It is crucial, essential, make or break. So spend time on it.</p>

<p>A good topic poses a <strong>specific question</strong>. If you cannot state your topic as a question, you are in trouble.</p>

<ul>
<li>A good topic: &#8220;What fraction of cross-country income variation is due to human capital?&#8221;</li>
<li>A bad topic: &#8220;What are the effects of more schooling on a country&#8217;s outcomes?&#8221;

<ul>
<li>This is too broad (effects on what?).</li>
<li>This is too vague (how does the &#8220;more schooling&#8221; come about?).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A very bad topic: &#8220;I explore the implications of banking regulations in Europe.&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<p>How to find a specific question? Start with a <strong>broad area</strong> that interests you. This should be narrower than a field (narrower than &#8220;monetary economics&#8221;, for example), but broader than a specific question (such as &#8220;What are the effects of Quantitative Easing on long-term bond yields?&#8221;). More like: &#8220;Unconventional monetary policy&#8221; or &#8220;College dropouts&#8221; or &#8220;the role of institutions for cross-country income differences&#8221;.</p>

<p>In order to narrow this down to a specific question, you need to <strong>read a lot</strong>. </p>

<ul>
<li>Start with surveys (Journal of Economic Perspectives, Journal of Economic Literature, Handbooks in Economics). See <a href="lit_review.html">writing a literature review</a> for more help on finding references.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t read papers in detail at this stage. You want to get the big picture.</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to <strong>understand the literature</strong> before you can identify a topic. </p>

<ul>
<li>You need to know what questions have been answered. What do experts agree and disagree on?</li>
<li>You need to understand appropriate methods and datasets.</li>
<li>This is why a <a href="lit_review.html">literature review</a> is one of your first tasks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Key points:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most topics are bad (too hard, not doable, already done, too vague, not interesting). <em>Expect to go through 10 candidate topics before you find a good one</em>.</li>
<li>Talk to people who know what they are doing early on; before you spend too much time on a bad topic.</li>
<li>It is fine to ask potential advisors to suggest topics.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="assignment">Assignment</h2>

<p>Your task for this week (due next Tue) is to identify a <em>broad</em> topic for your thesis. </p>

<p>You should post on slack a description of that topic and 3&#8211;4 survey references.</p>
