<h1 id="writingathesisorproposal">Writing a Thesis or Proposal</h1>

<p>Remember to <strong>back up</strong> your files (with versioning!). Every semester, I have at least one student who is late for a submission because his computer &#8220;crashed.&#8221; There is no excuse for this any more. Your files should be continuously backed up to the cloud (and regularly to a local drive).</p>

<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>

<p>A typical structure for an empirical paper would be</p>

<ol>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Literature review (see <a href="lit_review.html">separate notes</a>)</li>
<li>Empirical approach</li>
<li>Data and variable construction</li>
<li>Results</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="generalrules">General Rules</h2>

<ol>
<li>Aim for short sentences and short paragraphs.</li>
<li>The paper should have enough visual structure that a reader can skim it and still get the outline of what is going on.</li>
<li>Use an equation editor for math (or better: use Latex, which is made easy by using <a href="lyx.org">Lyx</a>).</li>
<li>Do not report numbers with lots of decimal places.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Intro is the roadmap to your paper. It should tell the reader:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the question?</li>
<li>Why is it important?</li>
<li>How is it approached?</li>
<li>Why is the approach reasonable?</li>
<li>What are the results?</li>
<li>What is the contribution relative to the literature?</li>
</ol>

<p>Things to do or avoid:</p>

<ol>
<li>State the question clearly and right away. Avoid many paragraphs of text leading up to the question. Questions end with question marks.</li>
</ol>
