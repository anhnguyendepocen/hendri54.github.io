<h2 id="fieldpapersinmacrointernational">Field Papers in Macro/International</h2>

<p>A field paper should contain at least a critical literature review. Critical means: the review should identify potential avenues for future research.</p>

<p>In many cases, students will have identified a potential topic by the time they start their field paper. Then it makes sense to keep the literature review short and focus on the initial steps of the proposed research.</p>

<p>Each student should get his/her topic approved by a faculty member at the start.</p>

<p>While field papers are eventually read by 2 faculty members, the &#8220;field paper advisor&#8221; will have an important say in the outcome.</p>

<p>For 2016, the due date is September 9.</p>
