<h1 id="howcanundergraduatesgetinvolvedinresearch">How can undergraduates get involved in research?</h1>

<p>The main organized path for undergraduate research in economics is the <a href="../honors/intro.html">senior honors thesis</a>.</p>

<p>Aside from the honors thesis, students need to approach faculty members directly and inquire whether they can work on one of the faculty members&#8217; projects. This works best if the faculty member already knows the student.</p>

<p>For help with this process, please contact the undergraduate research liasion; currently this is myself (Lutz Hendricks). Also see the notes provided by <a href="https://our.unc.edu/opportunities-and-courses/find-a-research-opportunity/">OUR</a></p>
