<h1 id="tipsforexams">Tips for Exams</h1>

<h2 id="slowdown">Slow down</h2>

<ol>
<li>Most exam answers are quite short. The trick is to approach the question correctly from the start.</li>
<li>Algebra errors are quite costly. They can be avoided by slowing down, writing carefully, and checking your algebra from time to time.</li>
<li>Read the question carefully. I often grade answers that clearly overlooked a piece of information that was given in the question.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="dontpanic">Don&#8217;t panic</h2>

<p>Don&#8217;t panic when an answer does not come together. Move on to the next question and come back to the one that bugs you later.</p>

<h2 id="explainyouranswers">Explain your answers</h2>

<ol>
<li>Just giving me a graph and letting me figure out the answer does not work.</li>
<li>When you draw a graph, explain why you think the curves slope up or down, etc. If you make a mistake, at least I can give you partial credit.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>

<ol>
<li>Make room. A lot of answers are very crowded. Then you find that you have to fit something else in and soon you have a mess on the page, where I don&#8217;t even know in what order I am supposed to read things.</li>
<li>If I can&#8217;t read it, I can&#8217;t grade it.</li>
</ol>
