<h1 id="openlettertorepublicanlawmakers">Open Letter to Republican Lawmakers</h1>

<p>In this letter, I ask you to take a step back and ask yourself: </p>

<p>Are the short-term gains to the Republican party (or to your career) worth the massive damage inflicted by the Trump presidency?</p>

<p>I take it as given that most Republican lawmakers disagree with many of Trump&#8217;s major policy proposals. The reason is simply that, not long ago, Republicans opposed those very policies essentially unanimously.</p>

<p>Examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>torture</li>
<li>&#8220;NATO is obsolete&#8221;</li>
<li>the annexation of Ukraine is acceptable</li>
<li>tariffs on companies that locate jobs outside of the U.S.</li>
<li>restrictions on Muslim immigration</li>
<li>massive expenditures on infrastructure (Obama proposed exactly that) without a clear way of paying for them</li>
</ul>

<p>This list could go on and on.</p>

<p>I also take it as given that you view Trump as not qualified to be President. The reason is simply that many Republican lawmakers and leaders said so during the election (of course, that was before Trump became the nominee). The vast majority of highly placed official in previous administrations agree.</p>

<p>How then should I interpret the news that Republican lawmakers go along with essentially all of Trump&#8217;s proposals?</p>

<p>The only interpretation that I can see is that Republicans have decided to put their party&#8217;s success (or their own) ahead of their country&#8217;s interests.</p>

<p>This strikes me as short-sighted at best. If you take the long view, it seems obvious that the Trump presidency will be viewed as a period that America should be ashamed of. Rather like the McCarthy era, but far more damaging to the world.</p>

<p>At some point, voters will recognize that Trump has lied to them and that his policies were harmful. They will also recognize that the Republican leadership has let them down by not defending their principles and values against misguided policies.</p>

<p>I therefore ask you to consider the question: Is the short-term success of the Republican party worth this cost?</p>
