# Light Rail Facts

* 17 miles, $2.4b (!), 
* projected 26,000 riders per day (update: this number is down to 24,000 per day on GoTriangle's website as of 11/20/2018)
* this would be about 8m riders per year
* for comparison: all of the bus lines in Durham taken together serve 6.3m riders per year (source: FTA)
* hence, the one rail line is supposed to serve more passengers than all of Durham's bus lines combined

* NSE projects compete with DOLRT
* ratings are included in PDF files. As of 11/23/2018, DOLRT is rated medium. All competing projects are rated medium-high.


## Revenue

Charlotte Blue Line charges $2.20 per rider. At the projected 9.5m riders per year, total revenue is $21m. The annual interest cost of the project is $120m.

## Cost Benefit Analysis

[St Louis Fed Report](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/central-banker/fall-2004/the-costs-and-benefits-of-light-rail)

* Light rail fares generally cover less than 30% of cost.

A [2010 Berkely Study](https://iurd.berkeley.edu/wp/2010-04.pdf) finds that, without externalities, almost no light rail system is cost effective. For Charlotte, breaking even would require an externality of $8.57 per trip. The only cities that are close to breaking even are large ones (San Francisco, New York).

But this line of argument is a losing proposition. Everybody will just argue that the congestion benefits are worth the budget deficits.

## Charlotte Blue Line

[Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_Blue_Line):

* 19 miles, 26 stations, 17,000 riders per day
* cost: $462m (compared with estimate of $226m)
* extension: 10 miles, cost $1.16b
