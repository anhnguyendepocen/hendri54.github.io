# Light Rail Facts

* 17 miles, $2.4b (!), 
* projected 26,000 riders per day

[Web site against the rail](https://stopthetrain.org/)

## Ridership

The ridership estimate is absurd.

For comparison: Charlotte Blue Line 

* 19 miles, 26 stations, plus 10 mile extension
* 17,000 riders per day
* population: 900,000 (Durham: 226,000; Chapel Hill: 57,000)
* so we have 1/3 of the population 60% of the line length, but we project 60% more riders

## Cost

Projected cost: $2.4b

For comparison: Charlotte Blue line 10 mile extension cost $1.16b.

Capital cost per rider:

* projected 9.5m riders per year (comparison with Charlotte suggests that this number is high by at least factor 2)
* interest cost per year at 5pct: $120m (more if cost overruns occur)
* interest cost per rider: $13
* but it gets worse: construction takes 10 years. A 5 year gap between cost and revenue increases interest cost by nearly 30%. So we are at $16.60 per rider.

This number will likely double because of cost overruns (about 100% on average) and it will double again b/c we will never achieve 27,000 riders per day. $50 per trip seems like a reasonable estimate.

For comparison [City Lab](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/01/why-its-so-expensive-to-build-urban-rail-in-the-us/551408/) estimates that light rail in the U.S. typically costs $100,000 per daily rider (just counting up front investment). In very dense cities (NYC), the cost can be as "low" as $25,000 per rider. 

## Revenue

Charlotte Blue Line charges $2.20 per rider. At the projected 9.5m riders per year, total revenue is $21m. The annual interest cost of the project is $120m.

## Cost Benefit Analysis

[St Louis Fed Report](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/central-banker/fall-2004/the-costs-and-benefits-of-light-rail)

* Light rail fares generally cover less than 30% of cost.

A [2010 Berkely Study](https://iurd.berkeley.edu/wp/2010-04.pdf) finds that, without externalities, almost no light rail system is cost effective. For Charlotte, breaking even would require an externality of $8.57 per trip. The only cities that are close to breaking even are large ones (San Francisco, New York).

But this line of argument is a losing proposition. Everybody will just argue that the congestion benefits are worth the budget deficits.

## Charlotte Blue Line

[Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_Blue_Line):

* 19 miles, 26 stations, 17,000 riders per day
* cost: $462m (compared with estimate of $226m)
* extension: 10 miles, cost $1.16b
