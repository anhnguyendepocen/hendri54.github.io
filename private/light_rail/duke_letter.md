# Letter to Duke University President Price

* Duke University president Vincent Price: president@duke.edu
* Tallman Trask III, executive vice president: t3@duke.edu

Dear President Price:

I was encouraged by the concerns that you recently voiced about the proposed Durham/Orange Country Light Rail (DOLRT). It is my view that the proposed light rail poses several additional concerns that I would like to bring to your attention. I think it is fair to say that the views expressed in this letter are shared by many of the residents who live in or around my subdivision. In fact, together we have submitted hundreds of comments to GoTriangle, unfortunately without eliciting a substantive response.

My main concern about the DOLRT is its **economic viability**. As an Associate Professor of Economics at UNC, I have some expertise to comment on this matter, even though transportation is not my specialty.

GoTriangle has not calculated (or made public) an estimate of the cost per rider. However, a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation reveals that each round-trip could easily **cost $100 per passenger**.

As a starting point, consider the following simple capital cost calculation, based entirely on the numbers provided by GoTriangle (likely optimistic):

1. Capital cost of the project: $2.45b
2. Assumed interest rate: 5% (my assumption)
3. Interest cost per year: $122m
2. Daily number of riders: 24,000 (GoTriangle website as of 11/24/2018)
3. Annual number of round-trips: 4.4m (24,000 x 365 / 2)
4. Interest cost per round-trip: **$28**

This calculation does not account for operating costs (about $7 per round-trip based on GoTriangle's estimate of $30m in annual operating costs). It also does not account for the fact that operation does not start until 10 years after the start of construction (capital costs accrue).

A more likely scenario: 

* Capital costs double to $5b (the typical cost overrun for public transit projects in the U.S. is over 100%), doubling the cost of a round-trip to $56.
* Ridership will be at best half of GoTriangle's projection, doubling the cost of a round-trip again to $112. Without going into [details](ridership.html), I base this claim on FTA ridership statistics for all U.S. light rail systems. The median system achieves 5.6 annual riders per person in the population. GoTriangle's ridership estimate implies a ratio of 24 annual riders per person. Not a single existing system is this successful. With 5.6 riders per person, DOLRT would transport 1.8m riders per year instead of the 8m predicted by GoTriangle.

Another way of looking at cost: Assume that GoTriangle is correct and we have 12,000 commuters taking the train every day. The interest cost of the project alone would be **$10,000 per commuter** per year. If my calculations are correct, that cost would likely be $40,000 per commuter. In other words, each commuter's average after tax earnings would be spent entirely on commuting to work. This is obviously an absurd mode of transportation.

For comparison: the FTA reports that Durham buses cost $3.17 per rider (operating costs only, but then buses do not incur road construction costs).

Why are DOLRT's costs so high? There are two simple reasons:

1. The Durham/Chapel Hill area is too small. Its population of 330,000 is about 40% of Bufallo, NY's, which is the smallest U.S. city with light rail (excluding a number of systems that are too small to be covered by FTA reporting requirements). ([See details on ridership estimates.](ridership.html)).
2. The construction cost of the DOLRT is quite high (even before cost overruns). $2.45b for 18 miles of track works out to $136m per mile. Even by U.S. cost standards, this figure is [high](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/01/why-its-so-expensive-to-build-urban-rail-in-the-us/551408/). 

Aside from the general economic viability of the DOLRT, there are concerns about the specific route that GoTriangle has proposed.

1. GoTriangle proposes to build a train maintenance facility in a residential area (at Farrington Road and Ephesus Church Road). This will generate substantial around the clock noise. The facility will store large quantities of toxic and flammable substances across the street from a retirement community and within a quarter mile of an elementary school. There is no evidence that GoTriangle has consulted fire or public health officials about the risks posed by the site. 
2. Where the track has to cross existing roads, GoTriangle plans "at grade" crossings for most locations. These will block traffic 150 times a day. They also cause traffic accidents.
3. Objections have been raised by DPAC and the American Tobacco Campus that "[Light rail could disrupt downtown Durham](https://indyweek.com/news/durham/gotriangle-light-rail-downtown-durham-DPAC-american-tobacco-campus/)"

Finally, there are concerns about the process by which the DOLRT has been promoted to the general public.
GoTriangle has systematically misled the public about some of the adverse consequences of the DOLRT. To provide one example: The noise and vibration study circulated during the public comment period downplayed the noise generated by the proposed maintenance facility (ROMF) which would be located in a residential area. Only after most of its public presentations were completed did GoTriangle release a [supplementary noise and vibration study](https://gotriangle.org/sites/default/files/0637b_rpt_sea-app-j-noise-and-vibration.pdf) (dated October 2018). If a resident wanted to find out about the noise generated by the ROMF, he or she would have to be aware of this study and peruse its Appendix J. It essentially overturns the conclusions of the original study and reveals that the ROMF would generate around the clock noise of 99 dBA and peak noise of 136 dBA (comparable to a jet fighter taking off). During a presentation in November, after the supplementary study was released, GoTriangle representatives still provided incorrect information about the noise. And even this information was provided only in response to audience questions. One representative claimed that the supplementary noise study contained no significant new information.

My conclusion from this evidence is simple: Light rail belongs in large, densely populated cities. Phoenix recently completed its first rail line at a cost of $65m per mile. The area population exceeds 3m. This is a case where the numbers can make sense. If the DOLRT connected the major population centers of the area (e.g., Raleigh with Cary and Apex), its numbers could work out as well. However, connecting smallish cities in the periphery just makes no sense - which is why it has never been done before.

Fortunately, alternative transportation technologies are becoming available right now that will render light rail obsolete before DOLRT ever goes into operation. Cities are already experimenting with self-driving electric van and bus services. These will be far more useful to residents because they solve the "last mile problem" which is arguably the main reason why so few commuters are willing to take trains.

In my view, the DOLRT needs to be stopped. I am therefore expressing my hope that Duke University will not donate land for the project and that you will continue to voice your concerns.

Sincerely,
Lutz Hendricks
