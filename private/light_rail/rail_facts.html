<h1 id="lightrailfacts">Light Rail Facts</h1>

<ul>
<li>17 miles, $2.4b (!),</li>
<li>projected 26,000 riders per day (update: this number is down to 24,000 per day on GoTriangle&#8217;s website as of 11/20/2018)</li>
<li>this would be about 8m riders per year</li>
<li>for comparison: all of the bus lines in Durham taken together serve 6.3m riders per year (source: FTA)</li>
<li>hence, the one rail line is supposed to serve more passengers than all of Durham&#8217;s bus lines combined</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ridership">Ridership</h2>

<p>The ridership estimate is absurd.</p>

<p>For comparison: Charlotte Blue Line </p>

<ul>
<li>19 miles, 26 stations, plus 10 mile extension</li>
<li>17,000 riders per day</li>
<li>population: 900,000 (Durham: 226,000; Chapel Hill: 57,000)</li>
<li>so we have 1/3 of the population 60% of the line length, but we project 60% more riders</li>
</ul>

<p>The FTA publishes <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/monthly-module-raw-data-release">ridership statistics</a> for all US light rail systems.</p>

<h3 id="numberoftrainannualridersperpersonlivingintheareaservedsource:fta:">Number of train annual riders per person living in the area served (source: FTA):</h3>

<ul>
<li>Median ridership per resident is 5.6; GoTriangle predicts 24</li>
<li>Maximum ridership per resident is 21 for Portland. But this is a clear outlier, likely because it connects to Seattle, so that the population served is much larger than that of Portland.</li>
<li>For Charlotte, ridership per person is 3.8.</li>
</ul>

<p>The smallest city that reports ridership data to the FTA is Buffalo, NY (population 900,000; 5 riders per person). This is nearly 3 times larger than Durham/Chapel Hill. </p>

<p>There are a few smaller cities that do not report ridership data. These are exempt from reporting because they operate few trains. We expect ridership to be small. The smallest of these cities is Little Rock, AR, with a population of 430,000 (still 100,000 more than Durham/Chapel Hill). The point: there is no city in the U.S. that is as small as Durham/Chapel Hill and operates light rail.</p>

<h2 id="cost">Cost</h2>

<p>Projected cost: $2.4b</p>

<p>For comparison: Charlotte Blue line 10 mile extension cost $1.16b.</p>

<p>Capital cost per rider:</p>

<ul>
<li>projected 9.5m riders per year (comparison with Charlotte suggests that this number is high by at least factor 2)</li>
<li>interest cost per year at 5pct: $120m (more if cost overruns occur)</li>
<li>interest cost per rider: $13</li>
<li>but it gets worse: construction takes 10 years. A 5 year gap between cost and revenue increases interest cost by nearly 30%. So we are at $16.60 per rider.</li>
</ul>

<p>This number will likely double because of cost overruns (about 100% on average) and it will double again b/c we will never achieve 27,000 riders per day. $50 per trip seems like a reasonable estimate.</p>

<p>For comparison <a href="https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/01/why-its-so-expensive-to-build-urban-rail-in-the-us/551408/">City Lab</a> estimates that light rail in the U.S. typically costs $100,000 per daily rider (just counting up front investment). In very dense cities (NYC), the cost can be as &#8220;low&#8221; as $25,000 per rider. </p>

<p>For comparison: the [FTA] reports that Durham buses cost $3.17 per rider.</p>

<h2 id="revenue">Revenue</h2>

<p>Charlotte Blue Line charges $2.20 per rider. At the projected 9.5m riders per year, total revenue is $21m. The annual interest cost of the project is $120m.</p>

<h2 id="costbenefitanalysis">Cost Benefit Analysis</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/central-banker/fall-2004/the-costs-and-benefits-of-light-rail">St Louis Fed Report</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Light rail fares generally cover less than 30% of cost.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <a href="https://iurd.berkeley.edu/wp/2010-04.pdf">2010 Berkely Study</a> finds that, without externalities, almost no light rail system is cost effective. For Charlotte, breaking even would require an externality of $8.57 per trip. The only cities that are close to breaking even are large ones (San Francisco, New York).</p>

<p>But this line of argument is a losing proposition. Everybody will just argue that the congestion benefits are worth the budget deficits.</p>

<h2 id="charlotteblueline">Charlotte Blue Line</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_Blue_Line">Wikipedia entry</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>19 miles, 26 stations, 17,000 riders per day</li>
<li>cost: $462m (compared with estimate of $226m)</li>
<li>extension: 10 miles, cost $1.16b</li>
</ul>
