# Notes on DOLRT Cost per Trip

GoTriangle has not calculated (or made public) an estimate of the cost per rider. However, a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation reveals that each round-trip could easily cost $100 per passenger.

As a starting point, the following is a simple capital cost calculation, based entirely on the numbers provided by GoTriangle (likely optimistic):

1. Capital cost of the project: $2.45b
2. Assumed interest rate: 5% (my assumption)
3. Interest cost per year: $122m
2. Daily number of riders: 24,000 (GoTriangle website as of 11/24/2018)
3. Annual number of round-trips: 4.4m (24,000 x 365 / 2)
4. Interest cost per round-trip: **$28**

This calculation does not account for operating costs (about $7 per round-trip based on GoTriangle's estimate of $30m in annual operating costs). It also does not account for the fact that operation does not start until 10 years after the start of construction (capital costs accrue).

A more likely scenario: 

* Capital costs double (the typically cost overrun for public transit projects in the U.S. is over 100%), increasing the cost of a round-trip to $56.
* Ridership will be at best half of GoTriangle's projection, increasing the cost of a round-trip to $112
* 	GoTriangle estimates 60% more riders than Charlotte's Blue Line which is 60% longer and runs through an area with 3 times the population of Durham and Chapel Hill). [Details](ridership.html)

For comparison: the FTA reports that Durham buses cost $3.17 per rider (operating costs only, but then buses do not incur road construction costs).

Another way of looking at cost: Assume that GoTriangle is correct and we have 12,000 commuters taking the train every day. The interest cost of the project alone would be **$10,000 per commuter** per year. If my calculations are correct, that cost would likely be $40,000 per commuter. In other words, each commuter's average after tax earnings would be spent entirely on commuting to work.

Why are these costs so high? There are two simple reasons:

1. The Durham/Chapel Hill areas is too small. Its population of 330,000 is about 40% of Bufallo's (NY) which is the smallest city that reports ridership data to the FTA ([details](ridership.html)).
2. The construction cost of the DOLRT is quite high (before cost overruns). $2.45b for 18 miles of track works out to $136m per mile. Even by U.S. cost standards, this figure is [high](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/01/why-its-so-expensive-to-build-urban-rail-in-the-us/551408/). 

My conclusion from this is simple: Light rail belongs in large, densely populated cities. Phoenix recently completed its first rail line at a cost of $65m per mile. The area population exceeds 3m. This is a case where the numbers can make sense. If the DOLRT connected the major population centers of the area (e.g., Raleigh with Cary and Apex), its numbers could work out as well. However, connecting smallish cities in the periphery just makes no sense; which is why it has never been done before.
