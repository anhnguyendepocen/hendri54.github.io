<h1 id="busrapidtransit">Bus Rapid Transit</h1>

<p>Bus Rapid Transit offers most of the benefits of light rail at a fraction of the cost.</p>

<ul>
<li>see <a href="https://reason.org/wp-content/uploads/files/bus_rapid_transit_and_managed_lanes.pdf">Reason foundation</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="costpermile">Cost per mile</h2>

<p>Dedicated bus lanes cost, on average, $11.5 m per mile (based on projects currently <a href="https://ti.org/antiplanner/?p=14829">under review</a> with the FTA).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.soundtransitrevealed.com/platform">Seattle&#8217;s Swift II BRT</a> cost $48 m (12.5 miles). The proposed Light Rail line would have covered the same path for $4.5 to $5 billion &#8211; 100 times more expensive than BRT.</p>

<p>Cost per mile of dedicated bus lanes: <a href="https://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_rpt_90v1c2.pdf">$6 to $20 million per mile</a></p>

<p>The Cleveland Health line is somewhat of a poster child for BRT. It is 6.8 miles long and cost <a href="https://nacto.org/case-study/euclid-avenue-brt-cleveland-oh/">$200m to build</a> (in 2008). It carries 16,000 riders per day. At $29m per mile, the Health Line is one of the most expensive BRT projects in the U.S. &#8211; it still cost less than 1/6th of DOLRT per mile.</p>

<h2 id="gotrianglealternativesanalysis">GoTriangle Alternatives Analysis</h2>

<p>When GoTriangle <a href="https://gotriangle.org/sites/default/files/do-aa-executive-summary-073112.pdf">evaluated alternatives</a> to light rail in 2012, BRT did quite well. </p>

<ul>
<li>BRT outperformed LRT according to &#8220;Goal 1: Improve mobility through and within the study corridor, Goal 2: Increase transit efficiency and quality of service, and Goal 3: Improve transit connections&#8221; (p. ES&#8211;5).</li>
<li>&#8220;Each of the three alternatives – LRT, BRT‐High, and BRT‐Low also meet Goal 5: Foster environmental stewardship&#8221; (p. ES&#8211;6).</li>
<li>&#8220;From a cost perspective, the BRT‐High and BRT‐Low Alternatives best meet Goal 6: Provide a cost‐effective transit investment&#8221; (p. ES&#8211;6).</li>
</ul>

<p>The only reason why LRT was preferred was its expected impact on &#8220;economic development&#8221;: &#8220;While the BRT Alternatives are competitive regarding most project goals, the LRT Alternative clearly surpasses the BRT Alternatives under Goal 4: Support local and regional economic development and planned growth management initiatives&#8221; (p. ES&#8211;7).</p>

<p>The Alternatives Analysis assumed that LRT would cost $1.37b (actual cost as of Feb 2019: $3.4b), while BRT was expected to cost between $810m and $960m. The assumptions imply a BRT cost per mile between $45m and $53m per mile. To my knowledge, the most expensive BRT project in the U.S. is the Cleveland Health Line at <a href="https://nacto.org/case-study/euclid-avenue-brt-cleveland-oh/">$29m per mile</a>.</p>

<p>Clearly, the alternatives analysis was heavily rigged in favor of light rail.</p>
