<h1 id="lettertodukeuniversitypresidentprice">Letter to Duke University President Price</h1>

</ul>

<p>Dear President Price:</p>

<p>On the eve of the Duke Climate Coalition&#8217;s meeting on the Durham Orange Counties Light Rail (DOLRT) I feel compelled to write to you. Duke University has the opportunity to stop a very expensive project the benefits of which could be obtained at much lower cost using Bus Rapid Transit (BRT).</p>

<p>GoTriangle has framed the discussion in a highly misleading way: either build DOLRT or be forever condemned to suffer traffic jams in our individual cars. Implicit in the entire discussion of DOLRT is the assumption that &#8220;no build&#8221; is the only alternative. This is false. The alternative is to think about better modes of public transit.</p>

<p>Most cities these days (according to FTA project documents) plan to build BRT instead of light rail. Wake county has decided to do the same. BRT is essentially light rail without tracks. Double length buses travel along dedicated bus lanes. The buses have priority at intersections (rather like trains at rail crossings). The main differences relative to light rail is the much lower cost of BRT. The Academy of Sciences reports that BRT costs between $5m and $20m per mile. Light rail is typically about 10 times more expensive. DOLRT is projected to cost about $140m per mile.</p>

<p>I need to emphasize just how absurdly expensive DOLRT will be. The upfront capital cost per daily roundtrip rider will almost surely exceed $1 million.</p>

<p>This fact is worth repeating. GoTriangle essentially tries to sell Durham a few thousand lifetime commuter passes at a cost of $1 million per commuter. It would be far cheaper to give away taxi passes or even to give free cars to rail passengers. The economics of DOLRT is that absurd.</p>

<p>The main reason for this is that the DOLRT service area is very small (by light rail standards). GoTriangle estimates a service area population of about 250,000 persons by 2035. This is one quarter of Charlotte&#8217;s service area today, and Charlotte is one of the smallest U.S. cities with light rail (excepting a few cities with very small light rail systems that presumably transport few riders).</p>

<p>The $1 million per person figure is based on the following calculation. The cost of construction, according to GoTriangle, is $3.4 billion ($2.5b plus $100m for the Durham tunnel plus $800m for accrued interest by the time the project goes online). The cost will almost surely be higher, but I shall run with GoTriangle&#8217;s figure. </p>

<p>However, I refuse to run with GoTriangle&#8217;s ridership estimate of 13,000 roundtrips per day. (GoTriangle reports lower figures to the FTA, but the 13,000 riders per day figure currently appears on its website.) Comparison with other light rail systems shows that this figure is far too high. Charlotte&#8217;s light rail transports 7,000 roundtrip riders per day. Given that Charlotte&#8217;s service area population is 4 times larger than GoTriangle&#8217;s projection for DOLRT in 2035, and given that Charlotte&#8217;s rail line is longer and has more stops than DOLRT, it seems inconceivable to me that DOLRT could achieve even half of Charlotte&#8217;s ridership. Yet even at half of Charlotte&#8217;s ridership, the cost per rider is $1 million.</p>

<p>Essentially all of the benefits that GoTriangle claims for DOLRT (jobs, investment, access to jobs, affordable housing) could be achieved at one tenth of the capital cost with BRT. The key point is: If Duke University refuses land rights for DOLRT, it will likely kill the project. However, Duke will NOT endanger all of the lofty goals that rail proponents hope to achieve. It will merely save the taxpayer a few billion dollars.</p>
