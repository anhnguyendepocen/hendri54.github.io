<p>Dear X:</p>

<p>With this letter, we bring to your attention our concerns about the proposed light rail maintenance facility (ROMF) to be located along Farrington Road in Durham. Durham city council is scheduled to vote on December 3 to rezone the site for industrial use. Once this happens, we foresee irreparable harm for hundreds, if not thousands, of surrounding residents and to the children attending the adjacent Creekside Elementary School.</p>

<p>Our primary concern is noise. The Farrington site is directly adjacent to several residential communities. It is also very close to Creekside Elementary School (less than 1/4 mile away). GoTriangle&#8217;s initial noise and vibration study suggested that neighboring residents did not have too much to worry about. We were promised (in this report and in meetings with GoTriangle) that noise would be subdued and measures would be taken to shield the surrounding areas.</p>

<p>Only after these meetings had taken place, and just a few weeks before Durham city council was scheduled to vote on the matter, did GoTriangle issue a <strong>revised</strong> noise and vibration study. It paints a very different picture, though the damaging information is once again obscured by placing in into appendices. The two key facts are:</p>

<ol>
<li>The site&#8217;s substation will emit a constant, around the clock noise of <strong>99 dBA</strong> (measured at 50 feet).</li>
<li>The site is poorly shaped, forcing the trains to execute 90 degree turns as they are moved around the facility. This will happen during the day and 48 times each night at a noise level of <strong>136 dBA</strong> (again at 50 feet).</li>
</ol>

<p>To get an idea how how much noise the decibel measures imply, consider the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>U.S. Department of Environmental Health guidelines limit workers to no more than 15 minutes of 100 dBA noise exposure per day.</li>
<li>The City of Durham Code of Ordnances (Sec. 26&#8211;4 to 26&#8211;22) prohibits sound levels exceeding <strong>50 dBA</strong> in residential areas outside the hours of 11pm to 8am. 99 dBA is <strong>32 times louder</strong> than 50 dBA.</li>
<li>The University of Florida lists leaf blowers as an example of equipment that generates <strong>99 dBA</strong> of noise. For such equipment, HCP recommends hearing protection and enrollment in a Hearing Conservation Program (HCP) if exposure exceeds 19 minutes twice a month. This is the level of noise that GoTriangle expects along Farrington Road <strong>around the clock</strong> where residential homes are located right across the road from the site.</li>
<li>The loudest piece of equipment listed in the same University of Florida document is a concrete saw at 112 dBA. Workers using such equipment are always recommended to participate in an HCP.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.chem.purdue.edu/chemsafety/Training/PPETrain/dblevels.htm">Purdue University</a> lists &#8220;military jet take-off from aircraft carrier with afterburner at 50 ft&#8221; as generating 130 dBA.</li>
<li>The average human pain threshold (again according to Purdue University) is 110 dBA.</li>
<li>Each 10 dBA increase doubles the subjective noise perception.</li>
</ol>

<p>If GoTriangle&#8217;s predicted noise levels are correct, Farrington Road would no longer be safe for pedestrians or cyclists. The surrounding homes would become uninhabitable, including the retirement community of Culp Arbor located right across the street from the proposed site. </p>

<p>One reason why the ROMF will be so noisy is its size and shape which force trains to execute sharp turns while moving around the facility. The site&#8217;s shape is also the likely reason why the extremely noisy substation is to be located right behind the 4 foot berm that separates the facility from Farrington Road.</p>

<p>Moving the ROMF to the Leigh Village area adjacent to NC54 and Farrington Road would sidestep these concerns. The area is adjacent to the planned light rail track and currently undeveloped. It would offer easy vehicle access via NC54 and I&#8211;40. In other words: there is a remedy that does not derail the entire light rail project.</p>

<p>There are several additional concerns with the Farrington location.</p>

<ol>
<li>The ROMF stores large quantities of controlled substances. This includes 1,000 gallons of used oil (after residents were promised that no oil changes would take place on site). Some of these substances are explosive. Others are toxic. This is supposed to happen within 1/4 mile of Creekside Elementary School. GoTriangle went through the entire planning process without knowing which kinds of controlled substances would be stored on the site. Last week, a representative had to compile a list based on chemicals stored at the Charlotte ROMF in response to a resident&#8217;s request.</li>
<li>The Farrington site contains wetlands which would be entirely destroyed. These wetlands help to control flooding of I&#8211;40 and surrounding areas.</li>
<li>The site prevents the future widening of Farrington road, which is one of only two significant roads that connect US15/501 with NC54. The other road is Garrett which is already crowded.</li>
</ol>

<p>After meeting with all Durham city council members, the neighboring residents are very concerned. It appears that our concerns are being ignored by city officials. We therefore ask you to intervene on behalf of the residents affected by the planned ROMF. Specifically, the project depends on state and federal funding (about $1.5b of it). We ask you to withhold these funds unless the city of Durham ensures that its residents are protected from the terrible effects of the planned site.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your consideration.</p>

<p>Sincerely,
Margarita and Lutz Hendricks
