<h1 id="romflocationopposition">ROMF Location Opposition</h1>

<h2 id="emailsentbyhendricksfamilytodurhamcitycouncil">Email sent by Hendricks family to Durham city council</h2>

<p>Dear X:</p>

<p>With this letter, we bring to your attention our objections against the proposed light rail maintenance facility (ROMF) to be located along Farrington Road in Durham.</p>

<p>Our primary concern is noise. Unlike the alternative Cornwallis location, the Farrington site is directly adjacent to several residential communities. It is also very close to Creekside Elementary School. It is highly unusual to locate an industrial facility in such a location. </p>

<p>The ROMF will be operated around the clock. Trains will start to leave the facility at 5am and return around midnight. Before departing, trains will test their horns. This process will start at 5am and last for about one hour at a noise level of 100dB. In addition, trains need to navigate narrow turns when entering the ROMF which creates grinding noises of around 130dB, comparable to a jet airplane engine. We expect this noise to occur throughout the night as trains are moved for maintenance. Even while the site is &#8220;at rest&#8221;, it is expected to generate 99dB of noise due to generators etc.</p>

<p>For any other source of noise, this would be entirely outside of the limits permitted by the City of Durham Code of Ordinances (Sec. 26&#8211;4 to 26&#8211;22). These prohibit sound levels exceeding 50dB outside the hours of 11pm to 8am. They also specifically prohibit the sounding of any horns, except in emergencies.</p>

<p>There are several additional concerns with the Farrington location.</p>

<ol>
<li>The ROMF stores large quantities of controlled substances. This includes 1,000 gallons of used oil (after residents were promised that no oil changes would take place on site). Some of these substances are explosive. Others are toxic. This is supposed to happen within 0.2 miles of Creekside Elementary School.</li>
<li>The Farrington site contains wetlands which would be almost entirely destroyed.</li>
<li>The site prevents the future widening of Farrington road, which is one of only two significant roads that connect US15/501 with NC54. The other road is Garrett which is already crowded.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Cornwallis location considered as an alternative during the planning phase would sidestep these concerns. It would replace an existing industrial facility and be located in a wooded area along US15/501.</p>

<p>If the Farrington site is built against the objections of neighboring residents, these residents will need to be compensated for their loss of home values. We would expect that these claims will result in lawsuits against the city.</p>

<p>We therefore urge to vote against rezoning the Farrington site for industrial use.</p>

<p>Sincerely,
Margarita and Lutz Hendricks</p>
