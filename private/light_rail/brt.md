# Bus Rapid Transit

Bus Rapid Transit offers most of the benefits of light rail at a fraction of the cost.

## Cost per mile

Dedicated bus lanes cost, on average, $11.5 m per mile (based on projects currently [under review](https://ti.org/antiplanner/?p=14829) with the FTA).

[Seattle's Swift II BRT](http://www.soundtransitrevealed.com/platform) cost $48 m (12.5 miles). The proposed Light Rail line would have covered the same path for $4.5 to $5 billion -- 100 times more expensive than BRT.

Cost per mile of dedicated bus lanes: [$6 to $20 million per mile](https://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_rpt_90v1c2.pdf)

The Cleveland Health line is somewhat of a poster child for BRT. It is 6.8 miles long and cost [$200m to build](https://nacto.org/case-study/euclid-avenue-brt-cleveland-oh/) (in 2008). It carries 16,000 riders per day. At $29m per mile, the Health Line is one of the most expensive BRT projects in the U.S. -- it still cost less than 1/6th of DOLRT per mile.
