# Bus Rapid Transit

Bus Rapid Transit offers most of the benefits of light rail at a fraction of the cost.

## Cost per mile

Dedicated bus lanes cost, on average, $11.5 m per mile (based on projects currently [under review](https://ti.org/antiplanner/?p=14829) with the FTA).

[Seattle's Swift II BRT](http://www.soundtransitrevealed.com/platform) cost $48 m (12.5 miles). The proposed Light Rail line would have covered the same path for $4.5 to $5 billion -- 100 times more expensive than BRT.

Cost per mile of dedicated bus lanes: [$6 to $20 million per mile](https://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_rpt_90v1c2.pdf)

The Cleveland Health line is somewhat of a poster child for BRT. It is 6.8 miles long and cost [$200m to build](https://nacto.org/case-study/euclid-avenue-brt-cleveland-oh/) (in 2008). It carries 16,000 riders per day. At $29m per mile, the Health Line is one of the most expensive BRT projects in the U.S. -- it still cost less than 1/6th of DOLRT per mile.

## GoTriangle Alternatives Analysis

When GoTriangle [evaluated alternatives](https://gotriangle.org/sites/default/files/do-aa-executive-summary-073112.pdf) to light rail in 2012, BRT did quite well. 

* BRT outperformed LRT according to "Goal 1: Improve mobility through and within the study corridor, Goal 2: Increase transit efficiency and quality of service, and Goal 3: Improve transit connections" (p. ES-5).
* "Each of the three alternatives – LRT, BRT‐High, and BRT‐Low also meet Goal 5: Foster environmental stewardship" (p. ES-6).
* "From a cost perspective, the BRT‐High and BRT‐Low Alternatives best meet Goal 6: Provide a cost‐effective transit investment" (p. ES-6).

The only reason why LRT was preferred was its expected impact on "economic development": "While the BRT Alternatives are competitive regarding most project goals, the LRT Alternative clearly surpasses the BRT Alternatives under Goal 4: Support local and regional economic development and planned growth management initiatives" (p. ES-7).

The Alternatives Analysis assumed that LRT would cost $1.37b (actual cost as of Feb 2019: $3.4b), while BRT was expected to cost between $810m and $960m. The assumptions imply a BRT cost per mile between $45m and $53m per mile. To my knowledge, the most expensive BRT project in the U.S. is the Cleveland Health Line at [$29m per mile](https://nacto.org/case-study/euclid-avenue-brt-cleveland-oh/).

Clearly, the alternatives analysis was heavily rigged in favor of light rail.
