<h1 id="whytrumpisstartingatradewar">Why Trump is starting a trade war</h1>

<p>Posted 2018-Mar&#8211;3.</p>

<p>Many observers still try to understand the motivation behind Trump&#8217;s policy actions. They generally try to understand which policy goals are served. This is a fundamental misunderstanding. Trump does not have <strong>policy</strong> goals &#8211; he has <strong>political</strong> goals.</p>

<p>In this light, how is a trade war beneficial for Trump?</p>

<p>The big picture is Trump needs to manufacture enemies that he can rally voters against. Immigrants make great enemies, but they don&#8217;t fight back. So how to get an enemy that fights back? Answer: start a trade war.</p>

<p>In a little while, we will see that Trump claims that China started the trade war. He will rail against unfair practices and complain that Democrats don&#8217;t do anything to defend the U.S. against this threat. Hence, he will say: vote for me and I will deal with those Chinese crooks.</p>
