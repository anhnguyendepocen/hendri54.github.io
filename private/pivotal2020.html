<h1 id="2020-theyearthatwilldecidethefateofusdemocracy">2020 - The Year that Will Decide the Fate of US Democracy</h1>

<p>At some point during the last 10 to 20 years, some Republican strategists and donors decided to look at politics in a new way. They asked: What if we simply forget about policy positions and just focus on votes?</p>

<p>Before them, politicians ran on some form of coherent belief system that could be supported with facts &#8211; or that was at least not wildly inconsistent with them. Republicans were in favor of free markets, small governments, balanced budgets, and little regulation. Democrats wanted fairness and regulation of market failures. Policy proposals and nominations had to pass a decency test. It would not do to appoint a political hack to the federal bench.</p>

<p>Then came the switch, based on the insight that one could maximize votes if one just abandoned all political beliefs. Maximizing votes meant taking control of every aspect of the political process and the news cycle. </p>

<p>One key insight was that many U.S. citizens are single issue voters. Republicans therefore adopted a platform that sided with the majority on every single issue item: climate change is not real; abortion is wrong; immigration is dangerous; trade costs jobs; gays are immoral; and so on. These views are held by relative small fractions of the population (though their numbers are growing thanks to propaganda). But those voters now vote 100% Republican, even if it means electing a Roy Moore.</p>

<p>The second key insight was that the U.S. constitution contains rather poor protections against power abuses by the majority. It is based on the notion that Congress will act to limit such abuses. This is no longer the case under the new Republican leadership. Example: Individuals who clearly lack qualifications (many judicial appointments) or who suffer from major conflicts of interest (Tom Price) or who previously accepted favors from industries they regulated (Tom Price) are confirmed with ease.</p>

<p>The third key insight was that people choose their facts. When you offer them the opportunity to believe what they want to believe, they will take it. In the past, traditional media prevented the spread of outright falsehoods. Social media have removed this filter. Which is why Republicans routinely characterize traditional media as &#8220;fake news.&#8221; It is then possible to literally sell policies to rich donors without major blowback from voters. In fact, policies that favor donors can easily be sold as being in the interests of the middle class (e.g., tax cuts on the rich; ACA repeal).</p>

<p>Given these insights, the strategy is obvious: sell policies in exchange for campaign donations. To cover it up, spread false information. place political appointees into all branches of government (including the courts). Rig the elections. This is what Republicans, in a loose coalition with extreme conservatives and the rich, have been doing for some time now. Although it is perhaps more accurate that the Republicans have been taken hostage by their donors.</p>

<p>These are some items from the Republican playbook:</p>

<ul>
<li>Republicans have blocked most nominations of the Obama administration that require Senate confirmation.</li>
<li>Republicans have nominated record numbers of judges, some of which are clearly not qualified. Their main qualification is that they are young and follow the party line.</li>
<li>The Trump administration is replacing careers diplomats with political appointees.</li>
<li>Gerrymandering has turned many elections into foregone conclusions. They are simply no longer contested.</li>
<li>One company controls 70% of local TV stations in the U.S. It is firmly Republican.</li>
<li>Fox &#8220;News&#8221; is effectively a Republican propaganda organization.</li>
<li>The Senate now usually passes legislation with a simple majority, bypassing the normal process.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2020, U.S. voters will either decisively reject the Republican bending of the rules, or U.S. democracy will effectively come to an end. If the party in power can successfully sell harmful policies to its base, there will be few limits to its powers. If Republicans are in power for eight years, essentially the entire judiciary and the entire body of career bureaucrats will have been replaced with party loyalists. We will have one party rule.</p>
